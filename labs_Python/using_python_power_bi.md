# Using Python in Power BI

This blog post focused on showcasing how to use Python in Power BI. We use the [Boston Housing dataset](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston) that is available from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html). In this example the dataset is used for clustering although it is  usually used for solving regression tasks. First we use PCA to reduce  the dimensions to 2 that will allow us to visualize the data in a  2-dimensional plot. Afterwards we apply K-Means clustering to identify  any homogenous groups in the data. Finally this data is utilized to make visualizations in Microsoft Power BI Desktop.

## Pre-requisites

This example assumes that Power BI Desktop ([download for free](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)) and Python + [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org) is installed on the system. Feel free to use a another instance of Python, you can check the required libraries from the `Pipfile`.

## Setting up Python in Power BI

- Clone or download the repository
- Open terminal/console and navigate to the `python_in_powerbi` folder
- Run `pipenv install` to install all required packages (alternatively run with the `--dev` option to also install pep8 linter)
- Run `pipenv --venv` and take note of the location of the virtual environment
- Open Power BI Desktop and open the `Options`
- Navigate to `Preview features`and enable `Python support` (a restart of Power BI required at this point)
- Navigate to `Python scripting` and change the `Detected Python home directories` to `Other`
- `Browse` to the `Scripts` folder that is found in the newly created virtual environment.
- Click OK and you're ready for Python in Power BI!

- `boston_housing.pbit` - Ready to use Power BI template. You only need to make sure your Python environment is configured in Power BI
- `boston_housing.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook, which contains the exporatory data anlysis and modeling work done to create the scripts.
- `boston_housing.py` - Script that is used to load the dataset in Power BI
- `heatmap_pc1.py` - Script that is used to display a heatmap of principal component 1
- `heatmap_pc2.py` - Script that is used to display a heatmap of principal component 2
